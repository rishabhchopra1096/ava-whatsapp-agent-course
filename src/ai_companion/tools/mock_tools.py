üß™ MOCK TOOLS - Placeholder tools for testing Pepper's ReAct workflow

WHAT IS THIS FILE?
This file contains "fake" versions of Pepper's AI capabilities that return mock responses.
Think of them like training wheels for testing the ReAct workflow before connecting real AI services.

WHY DO WE NEED MOCK TOOLS?
Testing ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) workflow is complex with real AI services:
- Real tools are slow (API calls take seconds)
- Real tools cost money (every test burns API credits)
- Real tools can fail (network issues, rate limits)
- Real tools are unpredictable (different responses each time)

Mock tools solve this by:
- Returning instant, predictable responses
- Costing nothing to run
- Never failing due to external issues
- Letting us focus on workflow logic, not AI service integration

HOW MOCK TOOLS WORK IN TESTING:
1. User: "Generate an image of a sunset"
2. ReAct agent calls: mock_generate_image("sunset scene")
3. Mock tool returns: "üé® MOCK: Generated image of sunset scene (saved as mock_image_123.png)"
4. Agent sees "success" response ‚Üí continues workflow
5. We can test the complete ReAct flow without real image generation

REAL-WORLD ANALOGY:
This is like using cardboard props during a movie rehearsal:
- Actors practice their scenes and timing
- Director tests camera angles and blocking  
- Everyone learns their roles and interactions
- When ready, they replace props with real objects for filming

THE MOCK TOOL CATEGORIES:
üé® Content Creation: Text, image, and audio generation tools
üß† Memory Tools: Search and storage of user information
üîç Search Tools: Web search and information retrieval
üìù Task Management: Note-taking and organization tools
