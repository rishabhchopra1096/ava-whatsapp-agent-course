ðŸ§  MEMORY TOOLS - Long-term memory search and management

WHAT ARE MEMORY TOOLS?
Tools for interacting with Pepper's long-term memory system:
- Search memories: Find relevant facts about specific users
- Store memory: Save new information about users  
- Context retrieval: Get conversation context and user preferences

WHY MEMORY TOOLS?
Instead of automatic memory processing (old memory_extraction/injection nodes),
the LLM now decides WHEN to search or store memories based on conversation needs.
