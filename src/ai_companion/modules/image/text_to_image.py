    ðŸŽ¨ SCENARIO RESPONSE MODEL - Structure for narrative + image prompt pairs
    
    WHAT IT DOES:
    Defines the exact format for when Pepper creates a story scenario with matching image.
    Forces the AI to return both a narrative text AND a visual prompt in structured format.
    
    REAL-WORLD ANALOGY:
    This is like a form that must be filled out completely - both the story description
    AND the image prompt are required fields that can't be left blank.

    Takes simple requests like "draw a robot" and returns detailed artistic descriptions.
    
    REAL-WORLD ANALOGY:
    This is like having an art director improve your basic idea.

class TextToImage:
    """
    ðŸŽ¨ pepper'S IMAGINATION SYSTEM - Pepper's ability to create visual art from text descriptions
    
    WHAT IT DOES:
    This class gives Pepper the power to create actual images based on text descriptions.
    When you ask Pepper to "show me what you're working on" or "draw me a sunset,"
    this system generates real images using state-of-the-art AI models.
    
    HOW IT WORKS (USER STORY):
    1. User: "Pepper, show me what your office at Groq looks like"
    2. create_scenario() analyzes conversation and creates detailed scene description
    3. enhance_prompt() adds artistic details for better image quality
    4. generate_image() uses Together AI's FLUX models to create actual image
    5. User receives beautiful generated image of Pepper's workspace
    
    THREE POWERFUL CAPABILITIES:
    1. **Basic Generation**: Convert simple text to images
    2. **Prompt Enhancement**: Improve simple requests with artistic details
    3. **Scenario Creation**: Generate contextual images from conversation history
    
    REAL-WORLD ANALOGY:
    This is like Pepper being a talented artist with an AI paintbrush.
    You describe what you want to see, and she creates an actual picture for you.
    The difference is her "paintbrush" is cutting-edge AI instead of physical art supplies.
    
    TECHNICAL APPROACH:
    - Uses Together AI's FLUX models (state-of-the-art image generation)
    - Integrates with Groq's LLMs for prompt enhancement
    - Supports both contextual scenarios and direct image requests
    
    USED BY:
    - image_node in LangGraph: When router decides Pepper should respond with images
    - Triggered by conversation context: "show me," "draw," "what does X look like"
    - Both WhatsApp and Chainlit interfaces
