‚öôÔ∏è pepper'S CONTROL PANEL - All the knobs and dials that control how Pepper behaves

WHAT IS THIS FILE?
This is Pepper's "settings dashboard" - like the control panel in a car where you adjust:
- Which AI models to use (engine type)
- How much memory to remember (fuel efficiency) 
- When to summarize conversations (cruise control settings)
- API keys for different services (keys to start different systems)

WHY CENTRALIZED SETTINGS?
Instead of hardcoding values throughout the codebase, we put them all here:
- Easy to change Pepper's behavior without touching code
- Different environments (dev/prod) can have different settings
- Sensitive info (API keys) stays in environment variables

HOW IT WORKS:
1. Values come from .env file (GROQ_API_KEY=your_key_here)
2. Pydantic validates types and provides defaults
3. Other files import 'settings' to access these values
4. If .env missing, app crashes with clear error message

REAL EXAMPLE:
In .env file: TOTAL_MESSAGES_SUMMARY_TRIGGER=20
In nodes.py: if len(messages) > settings.TOTAL_MESSAGES_SUMMARY_TRIGGER:
Result: Pepper summarizes conversations after 20 messages

THE SETTINGS CATEGORIES:
üîë API KEYS - Passwords for different AI services
ü§ñ MODEL NAMES - Which AI models to use for different tasks  
üß† MEMORY LIMITS - How much Pepper remembers and when to compress
üíæ DATABASE PATHS - Where to store conversation data

    üéõÔ∏è pepper'S CONFIGURATION CLASS - Type-safe settings with automatic validation
    
    WHAT IS BASESETTINGS?
    A Pydantic class that automatically:
    - Loads values from .env file
    - Validates data types (str, int, etc.)
    - Provides helpful error messages if config is wrong
    - Handles optional values with defaults
    
    WHY PYDANTIC?
    Instead of manually reading environment variables:
    - Automatic type conversion ("20" ‚Üí 20 for integers)
    - Clear error messages ("GROQ_API_KEY is required but missing")  
    - IDE autocompletion (settings.GROQ_API_KEY shows up in autocomplete)
    - Runtime validation (catches config errors early)
