# VAPI CLIENT - Handles making phone calls through Vapi's service

#
# üîó REAL-WORLD ANALOGY: This is like a smart phone system that can:
# - Dial any number automatically when requested
# - Set up the call with specific instructions for the conversation
# - Connect the caller to Ava's voice personality
# - Track call status and results
#
# üìû TECHNICAL ROLE: This handles the "outbound calling" side of voice integration
# - Creates Vapi assistants configured to use Ava's personality
# - Makes phone calls using your Vapi phone number
# - Passes WhatsApp context to voice calls for continuity
#
# üåê INTEGRATION: Works with vapi_endpoints.py to create complete voice system:
# - This file: Makes outbound calls TO users
# - vapi_endpoints.py: Processes voice conversations when users talk
