# VAPI ENDPOINTS - Voice calling endpoints that connect Vapi to Ava's brain
# 
# 🎯 PURPOSE: This file creates "phone call processing" endpoints that receive voice conversations
# and process them through Ava's existing LangGraph workflow
#
# 🔗 REAL-WORLD ANALOGY: This is like a "telephone switchboard" at a company:
# - Phone calls come in (from Vapi's voice system)
# - The switchboard operator (this file) connects them to the right department
# - The expert (Ava's LangGraph + Groq LLM) handles the actual conversation
# - The switchboard relays the expert's response back to the caller
#
# 📞 TECHNICAL FLOW:
# Voice → Vapi (speech-to-text) → This endpoint → LangGraph → Groq LLM → Response → Vapi (text-to-speech) → Voice
#
# 🌐 KEY INSIGHT: Ava's brain (LangGraph + Groq) doesn't know this is voice vs WhatsApp!
# We just change the input/output format, but the AI processing stays identical.
