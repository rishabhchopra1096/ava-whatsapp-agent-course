ðŸ“… AVA'S WEEKLY SCHEDULE SYSTEM - Detailed hourly routines that define Ava's realistic daily life

WHAT IS THIS FILE?
This file contains seven detailed schedules (Monday through Sunday) that define exactly what Ava
is doing at any hour of any day. Think of this as Ava's comprehensive Google Calendar written
in Python dictionaries.

WHY DOES AVA NEED SCHEDULES?
Unlike generic chatbots, Ava has a specific personality and life:
- She's a Machine Learning Engineer at Groq (AI hardware company)
- She's passionate about astrobiology and modern art
- She lives in San Francisco and has realistic daily routines
- When you message Ava at 2 PM Tuesday, she knows she's "in technical meetings at Groq"
- This makes conversations feel natural and contextually appropriate

HOW SCHEDULES WORK:
1. Each schedule is a Python dictionary mapping time ranges to activities
2. Format: "HH:MM-HH:MM" (24-hour time) â†’ detailed activity description  
3. context_generation.py reads current time and finds matching activity
4. Current activity gets injected into Ava's prompts before she responds
5. Result: Ava responds contextually based on what she should be doing right now

REAL-WORLD ANALOGY:
This is like Ava having a personal assistant who always knows her schedule.
When someone calls and asks "What is Ava doing right now?", the assistant can say
"She's in a meeting at Groq" or "She's at SFMOMA looking at art exhibitions."

SCHEDULE DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
- REALISTIC: Work hours, commute times, meals, sleep
- PERSONALITY-CONSISTENT: ML work, astrobiology interests, art appreciation
- LOCATION-SPECIFIC: San Francisco venues, BART commutes, local neighborhoods
- PROFESSIONALLY APPROPRIATE: Reflects senior ML engineer responsibilities
- HOBBY INTEGRATION: Balances work with personal interests

TECHNICAL INTEGRATION:
- Called by: ScheduleContextGenerator.get_current_activity()
- Used by: context_injection_node in Ava's LangGraph workflow
- Result: Dynamic context that changes based on real time
- Makes Ava feel like a real person with a real life and schedule

EXAMPLE USAGE IN CONVERSATION:
User (2 PM Tuesday): "What are you up to?"
Ava: "I'm currently in technical meetings and collaborative coding sessions with my ML team at Groq."
(Because TUESDAY_SCHEDULE["13:30-17:00"] defines this activity)
